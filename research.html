  <h2>Current Research</h2>
  <p style="font-size:100%; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
  <b>The Motivation</b>
  <br />
  The formation of structure in the universe is one of the key questions in
  astronomy today. Current cosmological models like &Lambda;CDM suggest that all
  ordinary luminous matter, such as gas and stars, collapse to form galaxies
  inside halos of exotic non-luminous dark matter which interacts only through
  the force of gravity. Cosmological simulations allow us to trace the evolution of
  small perturbations in an otherwise uniform distribution of dark matter in the early
  universe to the complex structure we see in our own Milky Way galaxy today. Despite this,
  we still do not fully understand how dark matter influences the formation and evolution
  of the gas and stars in galaxies. This connection between ordinary and exotic matter is
  a critical aspect of realistic models of galaxy evolution. In an effor to address
  fundamental questions regarding the growth and distribution of gas and stars in dark matter
  halos, we have undertaken a project aimed at correlating structure and star formation activity
  with the dark matter properties of the host galaxy.
  <br /><br />
  <b>The Data</b>
  <br />
  This project uses a statistically representative sample of 46 nearby galaxies built from
  existing deep near-infrared <i>Spitzer Space Telescope</i> imaging observations from the
  EDGES Survey (see Fig. 1).
  We expand upon this initial dataset utilizing an innovative combination of optical, 
  near-infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and radio synthesis observations of neutral hydrogen
  gas (HI) to perform a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of galactic disks as a function 
  of dark matter mass, mass in baryonic (or luminous) matter, and environment. Our ability to 
  synthesize observations at such a wide variety of wavelengths enables us to examine relations 
  between the fundamental components of galaxies in a way that has never been done before.

  the kinematic sub-sample of 46 galaxies (shaded blue histograms).</center>
  <br />
  <b>The Analysis</b>
  <br>
  The dark matter content and distribution in galaxies is being determined using the well
  established technique of rotation curve decomposition. This analysis method combines the
  derived galaxy dynamics from the observed rotation curve obtained from HI synthesis data
  with estimates of the baryonic mass distribution in order to derive an estimate of the
  dark matter distribution of a function of radius (see Figures 2 & 3). All radio synthesis
  data comes from archival Very Large Array (VLA) and Westerbork Synthesis
  Radio Telescope (WSRT) observations, as well as our own newly acquired VLA observations.

  <b>Figure 3:</b> Rotation curve decomposition of a kinematic sub-sample galaxy. The
  baryonic components are derived from measurements of the gas surface density and
  stellar surface density. In this analysis, we have approximated the dark matter halo
  as an isothermal sphere. The dark matter halo model is adjusted to achieve the best fit
  between the observed rotation velocity and the sum (in quadrature) of the different mass
  components of the galaxy.</center>
  <br>
  In addition to HI synthesis observations, high dispersion optical spectroscopic observations 
  of ionized gas will be used to trace the kinematics of the central regions of a subset of
  galaxies in Spring 2014. This new data from the SparsePak instrument on the WIYN 3.5m telescope 
  will allow a more detailed kinematic analysis of the
  central regions of the galaxies where structural features such as bars can create effects that
  are difficult to trace with HI. This will also enable us to better constrain the central dark
  matter density distribution, which has gained considerable attention due to a discrepancy
  between model predictions and observations. <br />
  <br />
  Comparing the distribution of dark matter in a galaxy to its structural and star formation
  properties will illuminate the correlation between dark matter and baryonic matter in the
  context of galaxy formation. The <i>Spitzer</i> data combined with optical observations are
  being used to evaluate the ratio of flux emitted at blue, red, and near-IR wavelengths.
  Differences in the flux ratios in the inner versus the outer parts of a galaxy indicate a
  change in the dominant stellar population (e.g. old to young). Current star formation rates
  (SFRs) are being measured from light in an emission line of hydrogen (H&alpha;), which is
  commonly used as an indicator of ongoing star formation activity (Fig. 4).

  <br>
  In order to understand how galaxies form we need to understand how the dark matter halos
  influence the baryons which form the gas and stars. The connection between star formation
  rate and dark matter fraction, for example, will highlight the impact of dark matter on
  the gravitational stability of the galaxy disk either supporting or hindering star formation.
  Similarly, correlations between the distribution of dark matter and radial gradients in the
  properties of the stellar components will better constrain disk formation scenarios, such as
  inside-out growth models.
