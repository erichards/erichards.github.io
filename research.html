  <h2>Current Research</h2>
  <p style="font-size:100%; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
  <b>The Motivation</b>
  <br />
  The formation of structure in the universe is one of the key questions in
  astronomy today. Current cosmological models like &Lambda;CDM suggest that all
  ordinary luminous matter, such as gas and stars, collapse to form galaxies
  inside halos of exotic non-luminous dark matter which interacts only through
  the force of gravity. Cosmological simulations allow us to trace the evolution of
  small perturbations in an otherwise uniform distribution of dark matter in the early
  universe to the complex structure we see in our own Milky Way galaxy today. Despite this,
  we still do not fully understand how dark matter influences the formation and evolution
  of the gas and stars in galaxies. This connection between ordinary and exotic matter is
  a critical aspect of realistic models of galaxy evolution. In an effort to address
  fundamental questions regarding the growth and distribution of gas and stars in dark matter
  halos, we have undertaken a project aimed at correlating structure and star formation activity
  with the dark matter properties of the host galaxy.
  <br /><br />
  <b>The Data</b>
  <br />
  This project uses a statistically representative sample of 45 nearby galaxies built from
  existing deep near-infrared <i>Spitzer Space Telescope</i> imaging observations from the
  EDGES Survey (see Fig. 1).
  We expand upon this initial dataset utilizing a combination of optical imaging and spectroscopic, 
  near-infrared (NIR), ultraviolet (UV), and radio synthesis observations of neutral hydrogen
  gas (HI) to perform a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of galactic disks as a function 
  of dark matter mass, mass in baryonic (or luminous) matter, and environment. Our ability to 
  synthesize observations at such a wide variety of wavelengths enables us to examine relations 
  between the fundamental components of galaxies in a way that has never been done before.

  the kinematic sub-sample of 45 galaxies (shaded blue histograms).</center>
  <br />
  <b>The Analysis</b>
  <br>
  The dark matter content and distribution in galaxies is being determined using the well
  established technique of rotation curve decomposition. This analysis method combines the
  derived galaxy dynamics from the observed rotation curve with estimates of the baryonic 
  mass distribution in order to derive an estimate of the
  dark matter distribution of a function of radius (see Figures 2 & 3). The galaxy kinematics
  are derived from both neutral and ionized gas observations. The HI data comes from radio synthesis 
  observations from new and archival Very Large Array (VLA) and archival Westerbork Synthesis Radio 
  Telescope (WSRT) observations. Newly acquired spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) observations
  from SparsePak on the WIYN 3.5m telescope provide ionized gas kinematics in the central regions
  of galaxies in which the neutral gas column density is low.

  <br>
  <br />
  The contributions from gas and stars to the overall rotation curve are calculated from the gas
  mass and stellar light surface density profiles. The gas mass surface density is measured from
  HI and CO (when available) integrated intensity maps. Model rotation curves for the stellar
  distributions are derived separately for the bulge and disk based on the decomposed NIR light
  surface density profiles. A constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) is used to scale the stellar
  bulge and disk contributions.

  The total gas (<i>filled squares</i>), stellar bulge <i>open triangles</i>), stellar disk
  (<i>open stars</i>), and dark matter halo model (<i>dashed line</i>) components are added
  in quadrature to achieve the best overall fit (<i>solid line</i>) to the observed rotation
  curve. Open circles represent circular rotation velocities derived from the ionized gas 
  (SparsePak) observations and the filled circles are from the HI (VLA) observations.</center>
  <br>
  In addition to the mass decompositions, we also derive structural properties of the galaxies
  using optical imaging to supplement the <i>Spitzer</i> 3.6&mu;m. We explore radial trends in 
  surface brightness, color, and equivalent width to search for changes in the dominant stellar 
  population. Current star formation rates (SFRs) are also measured from light in an emission line 
  of hydrogen (H&alpha;), which is commonly used as an indicator of ongoing star formation activity 
  (Fig. 4).

  <br>
  In order to understand how galaxies form we need to understand how the dark matter halos
  influence the baryons which form the gas and stars. The connection between star formation
  rate and dark matter fraction, for example, will highlight the impact of dark matter on
  the gravitational stability of the galaxy disk either supporting or hindering star formation.
  Similarly, correlations between the distribution of dark matter and radial gradients in the
  properties of the stellar components will better constrain disk formation scenarios, such as
  inside-out growth models.
